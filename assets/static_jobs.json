There are all kinds of other apps and tools that Datawrapper interacts with in the real world, like CMS’s and databases. Part of your job will be ensuring that those integrations are easy to build and run smoothly.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Extending Datawrapper</strong> to make sure it works well with large customer teams. When one person uses Datawrapper on their own, creating and organizing charts is pretty straight-forward. When there are hundreds of people creating charts in a large team, not so much! Ensuring that even the largest of our customers' teams don’t hit any walls when using Datawrapper will be part of this job.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who we’re looking for:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We’re looking for a full stack web developer to join our Berlin development team, <strong>preferrably full-time</strong>, but open to flexible work time arrangements.</li>\n<li>You will have a full, regular employment contract. Due to the nature of this job, it will <strong>not be possible to do this job entirely remote</strong>. <em>Please save yourself and us some time and only apply if you want to work with us in Berlin.</em>\n</li>\n<li>On the technical side, most of the work we’re doing is front end development work in <strong>JavaScript/ES6, D3.js, Bootstrap and <a href=\"https://svelte.technology/\">Svelte</a></strong>. There’s a PHP and MySQL backend as well, but that won’t be too much of your concern.</li>\n<li>We’re looking for somebody who has worked in web development before, but you don't need to have specific experience with our tooling or choice of frameworks. <strong>We’re happy to show you how our stack works.</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What the \"client-facing\" part entails:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A significant part of the job will involve <strong>interacting with users and customers.</strong> be it by phone, video call or email. We encourage everybody in our company to do this, but in this role it will be particularly prevalent</li>\n<li>That means we're looking for someone with <strong>good communication, interpersonal and written skills</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Strong English skills</strong> will also be necessary, as our users and customers sit all over the world.</li>\n<li>Not a must-have, but a plus: German skills, interest in or experience with data visualization, experience working in a software company.</li>\n<li>If you have <strong>any prior work you can show us</strong>, open-source or not, please feel free to include it in your application. We'd love to take a look at it. Even if you don’t, please don’t feel discouraged to apply.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What we can offer:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A big desk in our office in Berlin Prenzlauer Berg</strong>, where seven of us work (<a href=\"https://blog.datawrapper.de/about-us/\">Ivan, Lisa, Anna, Gregor, Elana, Hans &amp; David</a>). We have a massive library of data vis books, a coffee machine, tea en masse &amp; interesting conversations about mapping, data vis and UX. Also, we honour lunch breaks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flexible working hours.</strong> We're looking for someone who wants to work for us <strong>at least four days a week</strong>. There's no 9-to-5 culture in our office, though. Some people come at 11 am, some leave at 4 pm, others like to work from home from time to time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A question-happy, communication-happy atmosphere.</strong> We're all learning, and we want you to learn with us. If someone has an idea or a problem, we just talk. No meetings for most of us, a bit of Slack, lots of fun.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We don't care about CVs, just skills and attitude. If you don't find yourself 100% in the description, write Lisa an email anyway. Talk a bit about yourself and how your skills &amp; experience could be a good fit for this job, and ask us aaaaall the questions you might have:</p>\n<p><strong>→ <a href=\"mailto:lisa@datawrapper.de\">lisa@datawrapper.de</a></strong></p>\n<p>We're looking forward to hearing from you!</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Stride Consulting is a mission-driven, engineering-centric company. We seek developers who place a high value on continuous learning, and value diversity. If you consider yourself a non-dogmatic engineer, have a thirst for learning, and an eye for process, you’ll be in great company.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to leave our client teams functioning at a higher level than when we found them.  We do this by writing high quality code alongside our clients’ development teams, as well as mentoring their developers, product teams and stakeholders in software development best practices.</p>\n<p>We believe that practices like Test Driven Development, Pairing and Refactoring are the foundation of a high functioning software team. And, we believe that not all Agile practices provide equal value to all teams at all times. So, we approach each engagement as the unique opportunity it is.</p>\n<p><strong>As a Strider, you’ll find a learning opportunity that’s unmatched. You will:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be part of an engineering-driven culture, one that has a 4.9 star Glassdoor review and has won Crain’s -Best Places to Work 2 years in a row.</li>\n<li>Write high quality code with some of the smartest engineers in town.</li>\n<li>Immerse yourself in a learning journey that’s second to none. No where else will you find the variety that being a consultant brings, all a subway ride away.</li>\n<li>Mentor and be mentored. Learning weaves a thread through all that we do.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A Day In The Life of a Stride Software Engineer</strong></p>\n<p>You’ll co-locate and work onsite at your client (all are in NYC). We are proud to call the most outstanding tech teams in NYC our clients, ranging from funded startups to Fortune 500.</p>\n<p>You are empowered to define what work/life balance means to you. Every day for every Strider is different. Here’s how one day might unfold:</p>\n<p>9am: One-on-one with my manager. We grab coffee at Stumptown and talk about my career goals. I’m noodling on a complex React story and I get my manager’s take. We walk away with action items for next week’s one-on-one.</p>\n<p>10am: Daily Standup. I’m at work at the client’s office. They’ve got a really cool setup with dual monitors and nice pairing stations. I’m on a team of 4 Striders and 4 client developers. Our Product Manager kicks off the Standup. It lasts about 10 minutes and then we’re off to code.</p>\n<p>10:10-12:00 Pair Programming. I’m pairing with another Strider. We continue working on the React story from the day before. We have questions for the Product Manager that we ask via Slack.</p>\n<p>12:00-12:30 Travel to Stride</p>\n<p>12:30-1:30 Lunch-n-Learn. Today, Stride’s got a Lunch-n-Learn on Terraform Cloud that I’m psyched about. Stacey, one of our senior engineers, is leading the session. We hold Lunch-n-Learns every few weeks and I go to about half of them.</p>\n<p>1:30-1:45 Travel back to the client’s office.</p>\n<p>1:45-2:45 Retrospective. Retrospectives on my team are amazing. Today we’re retrospecting our last release. I’ve never facilitated a retrospective before, but my goal is to facilitate one this June. We have a nice rhythm and walk away with action items and confidence in the path ahead.</p>\n<p>2:45-6 Pair Programming. I get in a few more hours of coding. This afternoon, my pair is Amy, a junior dev who works for the client. I love mentoring and am really excited to have this time to mentor Amy. I’ve been coding about 3 years myself, so at first the idea of mentoring someone else gave me imposter syndrome, but the Stride approach is fluid and allows for flexibility and it’s been a huge career learning experience for me.</p>\n<p>6pm: Leave for the Day. It’s been a good day, I throw on my headphones as I head to the subway.</p>\n<p><strong>What you’ll be doing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing high quality code, and bringing a ‘teach a team to fish’ mentality to your project.</li>\n<li>Embed with development teams in some of NYC’s most exciting companies to help them up their game and get stuff done.</li>\n<li>Advocate for non-dogmatic Agile software development best practices like Test Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming, Collective Code Ownership, Continuous Deployment, and Continuous Improvement.</li>\n<li>Be part of a cross functional team that includes Striders (likely 2-6 Strider engineers plus a product manager) and client employees (likely engineers and other tech roles).</li>\n<li>Work with a variety of tech stacks, and a see a variety of tech teams. We embed with teams who write code in modern tech stacks such as Ruby on Rails, React, Angular, Python, Scala, Java8, Elixir, Node and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>You’re a fit for Stride if you have:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>3+ years of software development experience</li>\n<li>Experience in multiple programming languages</li>\n<li>Excitement to learn new languages and frameworks</li>\n<li>Experience with TDD, story estimation, test writing, and pair programming</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What you can expect from us:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continuous learning on things that you are passionate about</li>\n<li>Competitive Pay and Benefits (including Profit Sharing!)</li>\n<li>Empowerment to work at a self-defined Sustainable Pace</li>\n<li>No travel, all of our clients are located in NYC</li>\n<li>$2,000 and up to two weeks of your time for self-directed professional development</li>\n</ul>\n",

While we host some of these customers in the cloud, the majority prefer to install Squirro on-premise for security reasons.</p>\n<p>We need you to help us build out and scale this platform, as our customers apply it to ever growing volumes of data and discover new ways to structure and analyse that data.</p>\n<p><strong>Required Qualifications</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exceptional programming experience in Python</li>\n<li>Extensive knowledge of UNIX/Linux from a developers perspective</li>\n<li>Strong track record in software systems design, from initial implementation to performance optimisation and scaling</li>\n<li>Experience developing professionally as part of a team, giving and receiving code reviews, test-driven development etc.</li>\n<li>Good communication skills with fluency in English</li>\n<li>Swiss citizenship or work permit in Switzerland, or living and working in UK, EU or EFTA member state.

If you care deeply about issues like climate change, social justice, and economic equality—and want the work you do to make a meaningful positive impact on them—then we think you’ll love working with us and our clients.</p>\n<p>##A bit about the role\nOur Technology Team Lead needs a holistic understanding of modern web development techniques and infrastructure. They need experience building strong and scalable websites. They must thrive on being hands-on with development projects. They’ll need a leadership mindset, and must be capable of working on multi-disciplinary teams to communicate complex technological choices to non-developers.</p>\n<p>That’s all fancy job-posting language for: you really know your stuff and don’t have a big ego, you take responsibility for the quality of our work and the growth of your team, you still like to get your hands dirty with code, and you’re an effective collaborator—especially with people who don’t understand technology as well as you do.</p>\n<p>##A bit about us\nWe’re a diverse, close-knit bunch who are serious about having fun producing exceptional work. We play to win—for our clients, for ourselves, and for the world. We’ve got each other’s backs. We’ve got high expectations and we’ve got the work ethic to match them. We’re all together in the same open office, so there’s music and joking mixed-in with being heads-down on work.</p>\n<p>##A bit about diversity\nWe believe strongly that diversity is one of our greatest strengths—that the more perspectives we bring to the mix, the better we are as people and the better partner we are for our clients. So, in considering if Constructive is a good fit for you, know that all we care about is that you’re qualified to do the job, share most or all of our values, and want to be here. These are the things we’ll be evaluating for every applicant—and if you meet those and add to our diversity, all the better.</p>\n<p>##What we need you to do extremely well\nThis role combines technology team leadership and hands-on development, emphasizing one or the other at any given time. We’ll need you to have strong demonstrated success having done all or most of these things for at least 3-5 years—and a passion for doing them well.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Provide strong technical leadership</strong>—both for our internal team of developers, strategists, and designers; and for our clients and occasional external dev partners.\nManage and mentor junior developers—two in-house developers, one ongoing external partner, and any additional developers when project load requires it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Guide development team</strong> and our company on planning, prioritizing, mitigating risks, and balancing technical debt to meet project milestones so that we deliver exceptional work that meets expectations.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Work with stakeholders to define strategic goals</strong> and the context in which they need to be met, gather requirements, and produce technical documentation that makes it very clear how technology will help achieve them.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Develop requirements, specifications, and architecture</strong> to document what we’re building and what’s been built.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Lead development of ambitious digital products,</strong> serving as the point person for both the end-to-end process and the outcomes we deliver, aligning our work with Constructive’s broader strategic position as a leading brand experience design firm.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Be a hands-on developer</strong> who takes on specific aspects of complex jobs or plays a lead developer role on a project when needed.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Review code and provide feedback</strong> on work done by other developers; oversee the UAT and QA processes in coordination with project managers.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Improve best practices, recommend tools, and build frameworks</strong> that make our work more efficient, effective, and technically front-of field.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Be the face of Constructive’s technical expertise</strong> throughout client engagements, in the development community, and when needed in our sales cycle.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Contribute to developing proposals and estimates</strong> for technical projects, particularly those with complex requirements.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Lead vetting and hiring of web developers</strong> and external development partners.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Be a team player</strong> who knows how to lead, has a bias towards listening, takes serious pride in their work, and is always looking for our process and results to be better the next time out.</li>\n<li><strong>It definitely helps if you also have a good sense of humor</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>##Expertise that’s important in our work\nRight now, these are the specific technologies and tasks that are essential to our work. We’ll need you to have about 5 years of experience in most of these things, and we’re very open to new ideas on which specific technologies and tools can improve on what we have.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expert Wordpress &amp; Drupal development (Minimum 5 years of experience)</li>\n<li>Expert front-end development experience</li>\n<li>Strong experience with Webpack / Gulp / SCSS</li>\n<li>Strong experience doing large-scale content migrations</li>\n<li>Strong experience doing third-party integrations (Solr, Salesforce, Mailchimp, Fluxx)</li>\n<li>Experience with Data Visualization (D3, Highcharts)</li>\n<li>Experience with Infrastructure, System Administration &amp; DevOps</li>\n<li>Experience with ES6, Node, React</li>\n</ul>\n<p>##What’s in it for you?\nWork/Life balance matters at Constructive, and we do our best to make sure everyone is well-taken care of with a great mix of salary, benefits and perks, opportunities for professional growth, and a healthy dose of time off.

Het CBS levert als hét statistische bureau van Nederland met betrouwbare statistische informatie en data inzicht in maatschappelijke vraagstukken. Daarmee voedt het CBS het maatschappelijk debat, de beleidsontwikkeling en de besluitvorming en draagt zo bij aan welvaart, welzijn en democratie.</p>\n<p>Het CBS werd in 1899 opgericht vanuit de behoefte aan onafhankelijke, betrouwbare informatie om maatschappelijke vraagstukken te begrijpen. Deze rol heeft het CBS nog altijd. De organisatie is inmiddels uitgegroeid tot een innovatieve kennisorganisatie, die voortdurend nieuwe technologieën en ontwikkelingen toepast om de kwaliteit van de gegevens en de onafhankelijke positie te kunnen blijven borgen.</p>\n<h2><strong>Wat ga je doen?</strong></h2>\n<p>Je werkt aan het ambitieuze innovatieve product Information Dialogue dat alle statistische informatie van het CBS via toepassing van AI ontsluit, zodat een gebruiker precies díe informatie krijgt die hij nodig heeft.

    "description": "<p>Attention Senior Backend Developers:\n“Skyrocket Your Career As A Developer In The Dream Work Environment – While Solving Interesting Problems And Working With A Clean Codebase”</p>\n<p>You’ve finally found it…</p>\n<p>The perfect work environment to skyrocket your career as a developer.</p>\n<p>If you’re a talented, experienced and ambitious backend developer, then this page could literally change your life!</p>\n<p>But only if you keep reading.</p>\n<p>iPhone Photography School is the world’s no. 1 online photography resource. To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</p>\n<p>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built on complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.</p>\n<p>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</p>\n<p>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.</p>\n<p>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</p>\n<p>1 - Solve Interesting Problems</p>\n<p>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</p>\n<p>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</p>\n<p>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</p>\n<p>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</p>\n<p>2 - Work With A Clean Codebase</p>\n<p>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</p>\n<p>We don’t work like that.</p>\n<p>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better-kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</p>\n<p>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</p>\n<p>3 - Endless Opportunities To Grow</p>\n<p>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</p>\n<p>We get how important growth is for developers.</p>\n<p>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.</p>\n<p>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</p>\n<p>4 - Get Expert Guidance</p>\n<p>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</p>\n<p>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</p>\n<p>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</p>\n<p>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</p>\n<p>5 - Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</p>\n<p>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?</p>\n<p>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</p>\n<p>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</p>\n<p>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</p>\n<p>6 - Work From Anywhere In The World</p>\n<p>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!</p>\n<p>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</p>\n<p>7 - Stability You Can Count On</p>\n<p>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue.
